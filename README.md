# TwitterSentimentBots

## General
In this sentiment trading bot we are using Twitter API to get live comments and data for a specific coin.We store all the comments in a dataset and with this we train our bot to   separate the comments in three categories("Bearish" ,"Neutral", "Bullish").To make this hape we installed Ernie. Ernie is a machine learning python pakage very easy to use.[More information about Ernie](https://github.com/labteral/ernie).
