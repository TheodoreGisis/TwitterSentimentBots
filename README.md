# TwitterSentimentBots

## General
In this sentiment trading bot we are using Twitter API to get live comments and data for a specific coin. After that we are using a  natural language processing(NLP) to process all this comments and we are shorting then to "Bearish","Bullish" and "Neutral". To achieve that we used ernie python package.
