# TwitterSentimentBot

## General
In this sentiment trading bot we are using Twitter API to get live comments and data for a specific coin.We store all the comments in a dataset and with this we train our bot to   separate the live comments in three categories(Bearish,Neutral,Bullish).To make this happen we use Ernie.

Ernie is a machine learning python pakage that helps our trading bot to "learn" from the new tweets.[More information about Ernie](https://github.com/labteral/ernie).

Next we incorporate the CNN fear and greed index to make our bot more effective.This index shows what emotions is driving the market.
